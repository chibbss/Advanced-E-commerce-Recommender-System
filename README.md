# T5 Recommender System

## Overview
The T5 Recommender System project aims to harness the capabilities of the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model to develop an advanced and adaptable recommendation engine tailored for e-commerce platforms. By utilizing state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, our system provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences, browsing history, and item attributes.
